# Chip-Seq-Analysis

**H3K27ac ChIP-seq Analysis at Super-Enhancer Regions**
Objective:

Reproduce Figure 6D from Di Stefano et al.: "The RNA Helicase DDX6 Controls Cellular Plasticity by Modulating P-Body Homeostasis" Cell Stem Cell 25(5), 622-638.e13 (2019).
Analysis Focus
Examine how H3K27ac levels (measured by ChIP-sequencing in human embryonic stem cells) change at known super-enhancer regions following DDX6 knockdown.
Data Sources
• ChIP-seq data: Available as GSE dataset from the Di Stefano et al. paper
• Super-enhancer coordinates: From Hnisz et al.: "Super-Enhancers in the Control of Cell Identity and Disease" Cell 155(4), 934-947 (2013)

**Deliverables**

1. Reproduction of Figure 6D
2. Complete code and/or pipeline used for the analysis and figure generation
